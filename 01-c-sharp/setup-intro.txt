tools:
    visual studio
        (only .net core workload required)
    visual studio code
    git for windows (+ git bash)
        installs linux-like bash environment (terminal)
        also installs git, for version control
    .net core sdk
        lets us compile c# code.
        included with visual studio workload
        gives us "dotnet" command
bash commands:
    ls
        see contents of current directory
    cd
        change directory
    mkdir
        make new directory
    (tab completion)
        auto-complete directory/file names
    (up/down arrow)
        bash history, see and re-run previous commands
git commands:
    git status
        see current status of current repository
    git pull
        get latest changes pushed by others
    git clone
        make new local copy of a repository from GitHub
dotnet commands:
    dotnet new
        generate a new .net project from a variety of templates, e.g. "console"
        run "dotnet new console" in a empty directory, or,
        run "dotnet new console -n name-of-project" to create that project
        directory in the same step.
    steps to build & run code:
    1. dotnet restore
        download/update all code dependencies
    2. dotnet build
        compile the code (to CIL in a DLL/EXE)
    3. dotnet run
        run the compiled code (in the DLL/EXE)
vs code settings for windows:
    "git.path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
