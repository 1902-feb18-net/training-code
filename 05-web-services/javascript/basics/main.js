// JavaScript is the web's programming/scripting language.

// ECMA has standardized JavaScript w/ cooperation of all major vendors

// ECMAScript version 5 (ES5)
// that is the modern baseline version that all decent browsers support.

// the next version is called ES6, (aka ES2015).
// then we have ES2016 (aka ES7 etc)

// what web developers in 2019 write is a subset of ES6

// javascript is dynamically typed
//   variables are not locked to a given type
// that doesnt mean that javascript doesnt HAVE types
