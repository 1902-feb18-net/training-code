@* we do Views in ASP.NET MVC with CSHTML files *@
@* that contain both "Razor syntax" and HTML. *@
@* the Razor syntax is compiled when the view needs to be rendered into proper HTML. *@
@* razor comments look like this *@

@* below is a "Razor block",
    it switches us entirely into C# mode to have statements separated by semicolon.*@

@{
    // in here we write any C# we want and
    // it wil be executed at render-time.
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
